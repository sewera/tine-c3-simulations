# TINE C3

Scripts for simulation automation for TINE C3 (TCP) lab.

Put all the files (or all but the `virtual/tcp.tcl`) on the virtual machine.

You can use the `host/copy_csv` script to quickly copy files with simulation
results to your host.

Plotting is almost not automated at all. You have to uncomment everything you
want to have plotted. I attached it only to speed up the process or to give
some hints on how to do it. I'd highly recommend making a pull request if you
want to contribute to this script.
